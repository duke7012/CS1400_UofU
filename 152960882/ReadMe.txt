[FISH THE CAT]
	The game is inspired by our common favorite type of pet, a cat. In real life, cat loves eating fish. When we were making this game, we turned the cat into the main character and made it go through different challenges to feed herself fish. (That's why we call the action "fish" the cat, or feed the cat!).

[STARTING THE GAME]
	Extract the “_Resources” zip file into the same folder of “AvoiderGame.py”
	In order to start this game, open “AvoiderGame.py” and run the program.

[INSTRUCTION]
	Press “START” button to enter the game.
	
	The game starts with the storyline pop-up box. Read the message on the screen and proceed to the current level by clicking the “START” button. The player has to move their cat by moving the mouse to the targeted object(s) in order to complete the level without violating the rules.

	Each level contains different challenges to complete:
	- Level 1: Move the cat to the blue fish without touching the grass.
	- Level 2: Move the cat to the key to unlock the door. After the door is unlocked, a new path to the orange fish will appear. Follow the path to the fish to complete the challenge. Touching the grass throughout this stage is also prohibited.
	- Level 3: Move the cat to the randomly appeared fish in order to fill her stomach storage, which is initially given at 20%. For each fish eaten, 10% is added to her stomach storage. Meanwhile, for every approximately 1 second passes, her storage decreases by 1%. Challenge is completed when the cat reached 100% without any time either touching the water or having 0% stomach storage.

	The game finishes when the three levels above are completed in order.
